			<p>In 2012, I was working tirelessly as Lead Developer of BarackObama.com. I spent my days and nights buried in politics and staring at screens full of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk17f6_4iW8" title="President Obama's Election Night Victory Speech" class="modal">We won</a>. In 2013, I've been assembling an incredible team and building amazing things at <a href="http://www.newyorker.com" title="The New Yorker">The&nbsp;New&nbsp;Yorker</a>.</p>
