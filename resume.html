            <p>I led NYT Cooking's 25-person cross-platform engineering team.

            <p>In addition to my NYT Cooking role, I was also passionate about making The New York Times and industry-leading engineering organization. I helped improve and promote diversity as a founding member of the "Women In Tech" taskforce, partnered with our recruiting team to reimagine our engineering hiring process, and helped foster a remote-first culture as the company's most senior engineering leader.</p>
