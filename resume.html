          <p>I managed a 10-person cross-platform engineering team responsible for Lyft Pink. My team's platform is the heart of Lyft's transportation-as-a-service model and centralizes integrations for internal (Bikes, Scooters, Rentals) and external partnerships (GrubHub+, Chase).</p>

          <p>I led NYT Cooking's 25-person cross-platform engineering team. I was responsible for long-term technical strategy, scaling and restructuring the engineering organization as needed, and fostering an inclusive, empathetic, high-performing, and growth-first team culture. During my tenure, we built the paywall infrastructure to transition into a $20 million subscription product, scaled the organization and product into several new platforms, and delivered an unparalleled customer experience winning two Webby awards and the 2019 James Beard award for â€‹Publication of the Year.â€‹</p>
          <p>In addition to my NYT Cooking role, I was also passionate about making The New York Times and industry-leading engineering organization. I helped improve and promote diversity as a founding member of the "Women In Tech" taskforce, partnered with our recruiting team to reimagine our engineering hiring process, and helped foster a remote-first culture as the company's most senior engineering leader.</p>
