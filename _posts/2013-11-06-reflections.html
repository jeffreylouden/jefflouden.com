  <h3>November 6, 2012</h3>
	<p>A really wonderful girl told me recently "It felt like it was much easier for you to leave me than it was for you to leave the campaign." It feels impossible to disconnect the 2012 Presidential election as division of my first 30 years. There was everything before and now everything after. Everyone has these moments, but this is the first one that I'll simply never be able to shake and that time I'll talk about indefinitely.</p>
