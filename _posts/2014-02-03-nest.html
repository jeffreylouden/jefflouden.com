archive_intro: <p>At 31, I'm now a seasoned nomad. I've visited four-fifths of this beautiful country, I've lived in six different cities in five different states since I turned 18, and I've made a home in every city my heart told me I should -- except one - San Francisco, California. Until Now.</p>

  <h3>The Lonesome Crowded West<a href="#footnote-1" title="footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a></h3>
  <p>At 31, I'm now a seasoned nomad. I've lived in six different cities in five different states since I turned 18<a href="#footnote-2" title="footnote" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> and have been lucky enough to live in every city I once dreamed of calling home, except one: San Francisco, California. Until Now.</p>
  <p>I am so pleased to announce that this week I'm beginning a new journey with an amazing company full of brilliant people with brilliant ideas: <a href="http://www.nest.com" title="Nest Labs">Nest Labs</a>.

  <h3>Dear New York City,</h3>
  <p>It's not you, it's me. Can we still be friends? You were nothing but wonderful. You exceeded my every expectation. I am very heartbroken to leave you, but I have to do what's best for me.</p>

  <p>Forward.</p>
