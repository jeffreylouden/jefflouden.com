  <h3>The Lonesome Crowded West<a href="#footnote-1" title="footnote" class="footnote"><sup>1</sup></a></h3>
  <p>At 31, I'm now a seasoned nomad. I've visited four-fifths of this beautiful country, I've lived in six different cities in five different states since I turned 18<a href="#footnote-2" title="footnote" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a>, and I've made a home in every city my heart told me I should &mdash; except one: San Francisco, California. Until Now.</p>
  <p>I am so pleased to announce that today I join an amazing company full of brilliant people with brilliant ideas: <a href="http://www.nest.com" title="Nest Labs">Nest Labs</a>. Technology has such power to meaningfully improve the world around us and Nest is doing exactly. Whether it's <a href="http://" title="Nest Thermostat">saving energy</a> or <a href="http://" title="Nest Protect">saving lives</a>, Nest is engineering a better world daily. I am humbled and elated to join their team.</p>
  <p>I am also excited to join my former campaigners&mdash;<a href="http://" title="Matt Gipp">Matt Gipp</a>, <a href="http://" title="Sean Kealey">Sean Kealey</a>, and <a href="http://" title="Manik Rathee">Manik Rathee</a>&mdash;under such wonderful circumstances. Not only are they three of the best humans I know, but they are also all tremendously talented. I can't wait to build some really incredible things along side them once again.</p>
  <p>Mountain Monday is back.</p>

  <h3>Dear New York City,</h3>
  <p>It's not you, it's me. Can we still be friends? You were nothing but wonderful. You exceeded every expectation. I am very heartbroken to leave you, but I have to do what's best for me.</p>
  <p>To all the people I leave behind (who are too numerous to name individually<a href="#footnote-3" title="footnote" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a>), I promise to keep in touch. I am better for having known every one of you and I will see you again very soon.</p>
  <p>Forward.</p>
