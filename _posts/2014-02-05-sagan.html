  <h3>Class warfare?</h3>
	<p>Nearly every grid system I've used since the invention of grid systems have been class-based systems. They required some combination of classes within the markup to achieve an infinite number of page layouts. This includes a project called <a href="http://css.gd" title="CSS Smart Grid">CSS Smart Grid</a> that <a href="http://dryan.com/" title="Daniel Ryan">Daniel Ryan</a> wrote during the early days of the Obama campaign which we used for the next sixteen months. It was a lifesaver and much like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" title="Twitter Bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> it made developing rapidly possible. These systems changed the way most front-end developers outlined, prototyped, and eventually built their products, but they are not without their flaws:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>You need to include the entire grid (with all of its columns and offset classes) whether you used them or not. This additional bloat in a gzipped CSS file might be negligible, but it is still unnecessary if not utilized.</li>
		<li>These systems added weight to the HTML document. Markup has changed since many of these systems were introduced and the documents themselves are increasing in size with the addition of microformats, aria roles, and <strong>ALL</strong> the metadata.</li>
		<li>Responsive flexibility starts to suffer. Recently, many of the projects I've worked on required different column layout across break points and this is difficult to achieve without using javascript or overriding the grid system.</li>
	</ol>
  <p>These are all very solvable problems. The first iteration of Sagan was written approximately a year ago as nothing more than an idea for <a href="http://www.newyorker.com" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a> before I had officially started working as their Tech Lead. It made many of our responsive layouts much easier to build, provided more freedom to our designer, and resulted in measurable improvements to both performance and the size of our code.</p>

	<h3>The Basics</h3>
	<p>In its more basic implementation it might look something like this:
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/jeffreylouden/8372302.js"></script>
	<p>This would compile into the following:</p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/jeffreylouden/8372346.js"></script>
	<p>The previous CSS minified amounts to 601 bytes (287 bytes gzipped). Granted this is an extremely simple example, but since most sites implement a site-wide layout and only deviate from that in isolation, this is representative of an average use case.</p>

  <h3>The Options</h3>
  <p>Sagan has a ton of options available so only generate the code you actually need such as standard offset option, ability to push or pull sections, opt outs for a helper <code>.first</code> class and/or <code>:first-child</code> pseudo selector, and a lot more. Additionally, initial flexbox support is available with much more support planned in future releases. Please check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/jeffreylouden/sagan#sagan" title="Sagan on GitHub">GitHub</a> for a detailed list of the options and how to use them.</p>

  <h3>Installation</h3>
  <p>Sagan is available on <a href="https://github.com/jeffreylouden/sagan" title="Sagan on GitHub">GitHub</a> or can be installed via <a href="http://bower.io/" title="Bower">Bower</a> using the following command:</p>
  <pre><code>bower install sagan</code></pre>
  <p>and then import into your sass file:</p>
  <pre><code>@import BOWER_PACKAGE_PATH/sagan/_grid.(sass|scss)</code></pre>

  <h3>Caveats</h3>
  <p>A system like Sagan is clearly not perfect for every scenario. Most prominently, layouts like this <a href="http://www.getskeleton.com/#grid" title="Skeleton Grid">skeleton demo</a> or this <a href="http://css.gd/demo.html" title="CSS Smart Grid demo">Smart Grid demo</a> are much better achieved with a traditional class-based system because the additional markup necessary for such layouts is much lighter than the additional css Sagan would genera+respond-to($val: $tabletBreakpoint)te.</p>
  <p>Support for Internet Explorer 8 and below is disabled by default, but uncommenting a few lines within the code will fully support IE7/8 in all it's bloat-y goodness. This support is dependent on the presence of an <code>.oldie</code> class on the <code>html</code> tag. A mixin file is included that will scope your media queries automatically to <code>html.oldie</code> and can be use as follows:</p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/jeffreylouden/8402541.js"></script>
  <p>You can find flexbox support at <a href="http://caniuse.com/flexbox" title="Can I Use Flexbox?">Can I Use</a>.</p>
